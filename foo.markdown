The purpose of this course is to show you how to make apps for iPhones and iPad.

This will be a 16-week course for adults, and by the end of the course you will have written your own iOS app that 
will run on your iPhone or iPod.  We will meet two times a week. We will have instruction/lecture on the weekend for three hours, and we will also have a one hour online session once a week.

The purpose of this class is to teach you programming so that you can start a career as an iOS developer. It will be an intensive class, but by the end you should have enough knowledge and experience to start interviewing for iOS developer positions.

**You will need to use a Mac** to be able to write programs for your iPhone or
iPad. Obviously, a laptop (Macbook Air or Macbook Pro) will be ideal. A Mac
Mini would work as well, but will be much more cumbersome to use, since you
will need to bring a display with you as well. Please make sure your Mac is
running the Yosemite Operating System.


If you are interested in taking this class, please fill 
out [the form at the bottom of this page](#form) so that we can plan appropriately. 

The class will be taught by me, [Aijaz Ansari](http://aijazansari.com/about), the 
author of [Qur'an Memorizer](http://quranmemorizer.com) and other popular
iOS apps.  I have been working professionally as a software developer for 20 years, and have been teaching in one capacity or another 
on and off for the past 30 years. Most recently, I've spent the last year mentoring 14 students as they start their careers as iOS developers. 

The cost of the course will be $500 for the 16 weeks.
